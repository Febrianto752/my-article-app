              The choice of a web framework like Django vs Laravel is one of the
              most crucial decisions in web development. It can make or break a
              project because a web framework works like a “skeleton” on which
              you&#8217;ll build your web application.
            </p>
            <p>
              Django and Laravel are two of the most prominent web frameworks.
              Both have excellent features, functionalities, and capabilities to
              support and meet user demands in various industry verticals.

              The Django Software Foundation developed the Django framework.
              Django was initially released in the year 2005. Django was
              licensed by a 3-clause BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)
              license. Django is being used in some well-known websites like
              Mozilla, Instagram, Bitbucket, Pinterest, etc.; all the
              maintenance and releases will be managed by the Django Software
              Foundation. Django is lightweight and has a standalone feature for
              development and testing purposes. The Django framework&#8217;s
              primary goal is to ease the development of complex web
              applications in lesser time.

              Laravel was created and developed by Taylor Otwell. MIT License
              licensed Laravel. It was initially released in the year 2011.
              Laravel needs basic or advanced knowledge of PHP. Laravel can be
              used to develop Content Management System (CMS) applications.
              Laravel has upscale features in terms of more user traffic. The
              development time can be reduced in terms of framework feature,
              which provides inbuilt features to ease a developer&#8217;s life.
              Laravel has good features to develop a web application from
              scratch in an easier way.

            <h2>Key Differences Between Django and Laravel</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Below are the lists of points, describe the key differences
              between Django and Laravel performance :
            </p>
            <ol class="pl-5 text-justify">
              <li>
                Django is a high-level web framework based on Python that
                provides rapid development and clean design solution, whereas
                the Laravel framework is also a web application framework with
                elegant syntax and with different features such as routing,
                sessions, authentication and caching.
              </li>
              <li>
                Django provides rapid development, the greater community, great
                packages, easy to learn, great libraries, whereas Laravel
                provides quick development mode, dependency injection,
                application architecture, good community packages, MVC model,
                growing community, etc.,
              </li>
              <li>
                Django has few cons in a few features, which are unsupported or
                less performance templating, URL dispatchers, underpowered
                object-relational mapping, internal subcomponents coupling,
                whereas Laravel has few cons like huge static methods calling
                and slow performance.
              </li>
              <li>
                Django has various middlewares support, whereas Laravel has only
                HTTP middlewares. Django is a little bit faster as it uses the
                programming language Python, which is faster, whereas Laravel
                uses PHP, which is a little bit slower.
              </li>
              <li>
                Django has a lot of built-in tools like decorators, SEO tools,
                third-party libraries etc., whereas Laravel has simpler features
                and contains method injection.
              </li>
              <li>
                Django components are lightweight and have serialization and
                validating systems that are used to translate between web page
                forms and database values, whereas Laravel has a composer tool
                that loads all the dependencies and libraries using a file
                called composer.json file that is used to place in a source
                folder.
              </li>
              <li>
                Django supports Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) that provides an
                interface between application and database to persist the data
                from a database efficiently, whereas Laravel has query builder
                and Object Relational Mapping (ORM) support with an active
                record implementation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Django supports multi ligula support, which is compatible with
                different multilingual websites by its built-in
                internationalization system, which is present in its internal
                system, whereas Laravel contains different namespaces and
                interfaces which are used to organize and manage the resources.
              </li>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>
              Django web application framework supports Python, whereas Laravel
              supports PHP. The only differences between Django vs Laravel
              frameworks are that the language they support, and several
              different features and libraries exist to fulfill different
              requirements. There exist a lot of pros and cons as well as to
              understand the differences between Django vs Laravel performance.
              In terms of scalability, easier development, maintenance, and
              testing, Django is highly considered where Python also provides
              faster execution which further improves the speed of the
              application.
            </p>
            <p>
              The choice of the framework can be decided based on the language
              and framework&#8217;s features to fulfill the customer
              requirements. This has to be taken care of at the time of
              designing the solution for the application. In terms of user
              community popularity, Django rates well and good, and Laravel also
              rates nearly good similar to Django where it lacks some pros as
              compared to Django.
